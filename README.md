# Space04_BoneIDLE
A compiler for the 'BareBones' pseudo-language

The program should be run from the EntryPoint class in the boneIDLE package.

I couldn't get this to run from the command line, but it does run inside eclipse.

I've successfully exported a .Jar file that can be run for this as well.
